Calling 3rd Party APIs - 15-04-25

1. Write the mechanism to call - getAllProduct and getProductById APIs
on fakeStore
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will
internally call fakeStore and show the data

CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DB, does CRUD
model -> contains schema
client -> classes that will talk to other services

ProductService -> FakeStore Service
FakeStoreClient -> contains the code to communicate with FakeStore

Spring ->
RestTemplate -> becoming deprecated || today we will use RestTemplate
WebClient -> latest
